fitness:~
// Unfortunately, using true vertical position for optimization yields a very discouraging fitness landscape when
// evolution starts from simplest genotypes (like "X"). This is because the more sticks are added, the
// lower negative vertical position (a flat creature is pressed into the ground).
// To speed up evolution at this initial stage, we slightly modify fitness for creatures that have vertical
// position below 0. If they have few sticks, we encourage more sticks. If they have enough sticks, we encourage volume.

if (this.vertpos<0) //completely flat, pressed into ground. Let's build a better fitness landscape.

  if (this.numjoints<5) return 0.00000001*this.numjoints; //encourage more sticks
  else if (this.numjoints<10) //enough sticks (5..9) to expect some volume
  {
    var m=this.getModel();
    return 0.0000001*Math.min(Math.min(m.size_x,m.size_y),m.size_z); //encourage more volume
