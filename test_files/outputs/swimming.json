From experiments with pairs of sticks, I noticed that I sometimes saw a pair that swum with large \"strokes\" like a human swimmer, or frog.\nI started with two long connected sticks, with a bending joint. By trial and error, I added a chain of neurons providing a time delay between \"strokes\". I limited mutations to neural only during the early stages, and gradually increased the level of morphological mutations. Initially, behavior was very uncoordinated.\nEventually, a form emerged that used one arm to swim, while using a long stick as a counterbalance. I selected for velocity, distance and lifespan (...). At one point I selected the fittest swimmer, put it into a fresh simulation, and allowed radiation to occur from that point.\nSUBMITTED BY: Tom Hartley (t.hartley@ucl.ac.uk), 2000-01-01\nPERFORMANCE:\nThe counterbalance (tail) is rotated at the right moment, so that the arm is lifted out of the water.",
